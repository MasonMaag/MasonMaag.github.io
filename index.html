    <h2>Things I learned from building a site</h2>
    <p>I built a magic 8 ball site where you can create new questions and ask questions. The 8 ball can also give compliments and tell fortunes. There's also a mini game to play! I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to code this project. The packages included are axios calls and express server support. I learned so many things during this project, starting from scratch and building each component individully. I learned new styling techniques and how to build a canvas game. This project was a ton of fun and remains one of my favorite!</p>

    <h2>Bug fixing</h2>
    <p>While I was building out my 8 ball website, I ran into this bug that took some effort to squash. I was creating an HTML element in JavaScript that listed the question and a button to ask the question. The button wasn't pulling the answers from the controller when I connected it by selecting an ID. Then I searched through my code vigorously and found that the button needed to have an onclick event to get the function to display the answer. I learned that when creating new elements, you need a way to connect all the moving parts differently than if you had a hard coded HTML element.</p>
