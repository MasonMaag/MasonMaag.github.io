    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Mason, and welcome to my portfolio page! Take a look around and get to know me, see all of my work, and get in contact with me!</p>
    
    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Utah, and love everything the state has to offer. I love snowboarding, longboarding, hiking, and eating great food. Some of my hobbies are drawing/painting, music, and gaming. I have been coding for a while now, and love everything about it. The ability to create anything you want is what attracted me to this industry. I aspire to become a game developer, web developer, and a full stack engineer. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow! Feel free to reach out! I would love to connect with you!</p>

    <h2>What I have learned from building websites</h2>
    

    <p>
        I built a magic 8 ball site where you can create and ask questions. The 8 ball can also give compliments and tell fortunes, and there's also a mini game to play! I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to code this project. The packages included are axios calls and express server support. I learned so many things during this project, starting from scratch and building each component individully. I learned how to create servers, new styling techniques, and how to build a canvas game. This project was a ton of fun and is one of my favorites!
    </p>

    <h2>Bug fixing</h2>
    <p>
        While I was building out my 8 ball website, I ran into a bug that took some effort to squash. I was creating an HTML element in JavaScript that listed the question and a button to ask the question. The button wasn't pulling the answers from the controller when I connected it by selecting an ID. Then I searched through my code vigorously and found that the button needed to have an onclick event to get the function to display the answer. I learned that when creating new elements, you need a way to connect all the moving parts differently than if you had a hard coded HTML element.
